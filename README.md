# FACE-MASK-RECOGNITION
A Short term ( a little too short) project I did for Business Applications of Artificial Intelligence ISTM6218 at GWU. In the end the model fell short because of the lack of time (only had 3 weeks to implement) and lack of adequate training images and labeling for certain classes. Teammates were Eduardo Savioli and Hikma Awol
